Main server code for Within.guru

To run locally:

> git clone [..]
> npm install
> npm start

This will check out the entire codebase; download dependencies, and start the webserver. After start, opening a browser, and pointing it to http://127.200.0.5:5000    should allow usage of the entire app.

# Development notes:
Using forever is highly recommended for development:

> [sudo] npm install forever -g
> forever start --watch within.js
> forever list
> tail -f  [forever logfile from the above]

This will start the script, and monitor the folder for changes. Editing, and saving any file will immediately restart the script. This allows development cycle of: [editing some file] -> [ctrl/cmd]+s, [cmd/alt]+tab to chrome, f5 for page refresh, observe changes, [cmd/alt]+tab back to editor.
